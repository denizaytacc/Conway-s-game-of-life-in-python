# Conway-s-game-of-life-in-python

Game of life, also known as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by Mathematician John Conway. Every cell is marked as either dead or alive.
The game only has 3 rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
